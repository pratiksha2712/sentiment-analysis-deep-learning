# Sentiment-Analysis-deep-learning


## Dataset 
Here we used the dataset provided in the kaggle challenge link: https://www.kaggle.com/t/38fb9af3b5ab478db84d5cd8272265be

## Interpretation of data
The dataset consisted of reviews of a certain place on Yelp! and labels associated with those reviews (could be interpreted as stars).
Label meaning:
0 - negative review
1 - neutral review
2 - positive review

## Problem Task
Our job was to classify a test set of reviews and assign them labels based on their content.

## Results
We have used various approaches to go about this problem and have found that LSTM, a modified RNN approach works the best among the ones chosen. We recorded a final accuracy of 90.727% on the test dataset.
